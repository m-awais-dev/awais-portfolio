            <p>What&apos;s Up Everyone, I&apos;m AquaWolf from Miami, FL</p>
            <p>
              So, my story&apos;s kinda wild. Started my coding journey back in 2016
              learning the fundamentals, but I quickly got swept up in the JavaScript
              revolution that was transforming the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              React, TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js - I dove headfirst into the modern
              ecosystem. But what really captured me was the intersection of design and
              technology - mastering Figma, UI/UX principles, and creating interfaces
              that weren&apos;t just functional, but genuinely delightful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I became truly full-stack in the modern sense - designing intelligent
              user experiences in Figma, developing with cutting-edge frameworks,
              and deploying scalable applications. This wave carried me straight
              into the crypto craze of October 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              Helped launch some really big NFT projects - DAW, TheLostKingdom &
              SuperFuzz. My code generated over 28m+ and I achieved massive personal
              success...
            </p>
            <p>But fuck, burnout hit me like a big 18 wheeler truck.</p>
            <p>I was lost, ship wrecked, stranded at sea with no boat.</p>
            <p>
              So I decided to shake things up. Went on a spiritual vision quest,
              traveling the world for 2 years, searching for meaning and healing
              from the chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deep dive into consciousness, healing, and rediscovering what truly
              mattered. I was so broken I honestly didn&apos;t even want to code
              anymore, but eventually I found my way back to myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              And here&apos;s the beautiful part - I came back to find the world had
              transformed. AI wasn&apos;t just a buzzword anymore - it was revolutionizing
              how we build, design, and think about user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I truly understand how everything connects. AI-powered design workflows,
              intelligent TypeScript applications, Next.js with built-in AI capabilities,
              the entire modern stack working in harmony. I can take an idea from AI-assisted
              design in Figma to production deployment with intelligent features baked in.
            </p>
            <p>So, now I&apos;m back in the mix, wearing a bunch of hats:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>AI-Powered Full-Stack Developer (TypeScript, React, Next.js)</li>
              <li>UI/UX Designer & AI Design Tools Expert</li>
              <li>DevOps Engineer (Modern Cloud & AI Infrastructure)</li>
              <li>Live Stream Coding (Building AI-Powered Projects)</li>
              <li>AI Integration Specialist & Creative Problem Solver</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              My mission is to bridge the gap between AI, design, and development, creating
              intelligent end-to-end solutions from concept to deployment. I believe in building
              experiences that are not just technically robust but also beautifully designed,
              AI-enhanced, and meaningfully crafted for the future.
